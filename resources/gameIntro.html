    <h1>Greetings,</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>"Teacher vs Teacher"</strong> where minimalistic fun meets the FMI, offering a unique and straightforward gameplay experience that is sure to entertain.</p>
    
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>It's simple!</p>
    <p>You only need a mouse and touchScreen for controls.</p>
		<p>Keep your finger/mouse inside the game to not have it paused.</p>		 
		<strong>Touch Interaction:</strong> Touch and hold the screen for over a second to keep the game active. 
		<p>Stay alert and nimble to avoid hitting any obstacles that might appear.</p>
    
    <h2>Quick Restart</h2>
    <p>Dying is easy. If you get hit, the game immediately restarts.</p>
    
    <h2>Pause and Play</h2>
    <p>The game intelligently pauses when there's no interaction, resuming only when you're ready to continue your quest.</p>
    
    <h2>Enemy Behaviour</h2>
    <p>Enemies spawn outside the screen, and go towards the player (mouse) faster the further they are from them.</p>
    
    <h2>How to Win</h2>
    <p>There isn't a specific end sequence, the goal being to get the biggest highscore through determination and patience. Score is calculated as how many tenths of a second have passed since the start of the game (excluding pauses).</p>
